## Heading ##
  FIND THE BEST SONGS EVER...err...FOR THE DAY!

## Sub-Heading ##
  For all the 16-35 year old hipsters that are unable to access HypeM.com and want to access the top popular music blogs.

## Summary ##
  Basically this is an blog aggregator through another blog aggregator. Instead of being able to stream songs via HypeM, you can see a
  brief description of each top song and a link will be displayed to send you to the blog. 
  Also has the ability to filter by Band, Song, or Blog.

## Problem ##
  For people that don't want to use HypeM but still want really basic functionality the site provided.

## Solution ##
  By stripping down the entire HypeM idea into a Single Page App with filtering and links to click on, we have given users
  the ability to bypass the HypeMachine site. Crazyyyy!

## Quote from You ##
  "Oh, there's a cool site that lets you check out trendy music? Well we can do that too. In a much more basic way."

## How to Get Started ##
  Simply create a login and you now have access to the blog aggregator. Browse the page for what interests you or filter by your
  favorite band/blog.

## Customer Quote ##
  "Wow, crazy! I was sick of typing in HypeM.com and streaming music directly. Now I have to go through two, maybe three extra steps and
  I friggin' LOVE it."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  What are you waiting for? Go to our site, log in. Browse. Spend more of your day doing this and have fun!
